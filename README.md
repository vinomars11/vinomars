## Beginners guide to Glasp
This article gives a brief overview on Glasp and some of its basic and most advanced feature.

Glasp lets you highlight  all kinds of web articles on the spot. It does not use a reader view and thus allows the highlighted text to preserve the original article formatting.
In addition, you can also highlight **PDF** files and **YouTube** transcripts.

The app allows you to choose four colors and specify their labels when highlighting, to make it personal for users. For example, you can denote yellow for highlights that ignite your interest or Green for useful points and so on.

When it comes to note-taking, you have the option to take notes on a particular highlight or on the overall web content. You can add notes on highlighted contents through he Glasp menu and clicking on any of your highlights.
Your highlights and notes are stored on your profile page on Glasp's website

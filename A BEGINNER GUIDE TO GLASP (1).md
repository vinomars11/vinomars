## Why you should use Glasp
As previously said, Glasp offers some basic features that distinguish it from other highlighter apps. Some are unique and will make your highlighting experience more enjoyable. Among these are:

- **Import and export highlights**: Highlights and notes from Kindle may be imported and exported using Glasp. This procedure entails importing either all highlights or a specific book from Kindle Cloud Reader's notes and highlights. There is currently no way to import My Clippings text files from Kindle devices. Kindle highlights and notes are not visible to the general public. Only you have access to the highlights on your Glasp profile's Kindle tab. Other users will only see the title, author, and book cover. Glasp exports highlights and notes from individual site content as well as in batches. You can export in the following file formats: txt, CSV, HTML, MD, and png.

- **Visibility of highlights and notes**: All of your highlights and notes from web content you consume are automatically shared and exposed to the public. This is a tool that is intended to enable users to share their insights with other learners, however some people may object and prefer their highlights and notes to stay private. Your imported Kindle highlights and notes are the only ones that are private. Users can only see the book's cover, title, and author.
  
 

- **Bookmarking**: Glasp lacks the bookmarking option seen in most read-it-later apps. It does, however, allow you to save another user's highlights on site content. These will appear on your profile page under the Saved tab.

Although Glasp integrates with fewer applications than its competitors, it offers more AI features such as writing assistance, personalized summaries, YouTube summaries, and digital clones.
